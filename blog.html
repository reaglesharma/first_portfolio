              12 Things You Need to Know Before Betting The 2022 NBA Finals
            </h2>
            <p>
              The matchups are yet to be decided, but here are 12 facts you
              should know before placing your NBA Finals bets. <br />
              Some of these little-known facts and figures can be the keys to
              placing winning bets. <br />But keep in mind, betting lines are
              subject to change. <br />Online sportsbooks such as BetUS.com
              update their NBA odds regularly.<br />
              * The winner of Game 1 has claimed the title in 14 of the last 20
              NBA Finals.<br />
              * The home team has won Game One in 15 of the last 16 NBA Finals,
              excluding the 2020 championship, which was played on a neutral
              court. <br />That trend could continue, so keep an eye on the NBA
              lines once the Finals are decided. <br />

            <h2>Celebrate 10 Years of California Avocado Month this June</h2>
            <p>
              Ten years ago, the California Avocado Commission first observed
              June officially as California Avocado Month and is excited to
              continue celebrating this long-standing tradition.<br />
              As an ode to the past ten years, the Commission has enlisted the
              culinary talents of Southern California-native Chef Nyesha
              Arrington to create delicious and seasonal recipes that
              prominently feature California avocados, which are grown by about
              3,000 California avocado growers with groves from San Diego to
              Monterey.<br />Arrington has been celebrated throughout her career
              for using farm fresh, locally and responsibly sourced ingredients,
              which made her the perfect partner to craft customized dishes for
              this celebratory anniversary.<br />

              priorities change," says Cary Carbonaro, CFP.®<br />
              "One of the most important things you can do right now is
              understand how your retirement will change and then budget for
              those different phases.<br />"Carbonaro suggests thinking of
              retirement in three phases:<br />
